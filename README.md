# The-Legend-of-Zelda-NES

As part of a team assignment for GAP 305 "Programming for Production", we recreated the classic Legend of Zelda (NES) in Unity, focusing on replicating its iconic top-down gameplay, visual style, and mechanics. I worked with two teammates, who handled the UI, menus, and enemy behaviors, while I was solely responsible for implementing all core gameplay systems.

My responsibilities included:

    Linkâ€™s movement and animation control
    Combat mechanics, including sword attacks and projectile interactions
    World navigation and camera transitions between map sections
    Collision detection and environment interaction (e.g., walls, doors, objects)
